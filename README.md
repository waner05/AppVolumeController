# AppVolumeController
This project is a volume controller that uses an ESP32 microcontroller, a KY-040 rotary encoder, and a GC9A01 round TFT display to control and visualize the audio levels of selected applications on a Windows PC. A python desktop client is communicated through UART to dynamically adjusts volume and application icon for the selected Windows processes in real time.
